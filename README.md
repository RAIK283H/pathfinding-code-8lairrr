# Pathfinding Starter Code

my statistic:

my random pathing algorithm:
    my random pathing algorithm generates a path through the graph by selecting a random neighbor at each step from the start node to the target node, and then from the target node to the exit node. after initializing all the nodes needed and identifying which nodes have been visited, the algorithm enters a loop where it selects unvisited neighboring nodes to continue the path. once the target node is reached, the algorithm aims to reach the exit node. the algorithm also prevents revisiting nodes by ensuring there are no loops.
