#finds all permutations of natural numbers

#check for hamiltonian from nodes 1 until n-1 (not start or end node)

#returns sequence of nodes if hamiltonian path
#returns None if no paths

#write unit tests

#bonus: indicate which hamiltonian cycles are optimal in terms of overall distance
#bonus 2: indicate the largest "clique" aka a subset of nodes representing a complete graph
